# MiniAdventure
Basic 1984 Text-Based Adventure (CLI)

This is adventure program #1 from the book, which as far as adventure
games goes, is very crude at best, but it incorporates some of the
powerful features of the PASCAL language, and as such, it is a very
good learning tool. There are two more programs in the book, each a
more expanded and complex version of the previous one.

With minor modifications, this code has been modified to work with
ModernPascal.com command line interface (Windows, Mac, Linux). This
is part of our $24.99 "Building your first video game" tutorials.

This program was originally published in the book:
   "Programming Your Own Adventure Games in PASCAL"
   by Richard C. Vile, Jr., published by TAB Books, Inc.,
   Blue Ridge Summit, PA. 17214  308 pg., $13.95
